# What are DOTs ?

DOT is the native token for the Polkadot network in a similar way BTC is the native token for Bitcoin or Ether the native token for the Ethereum Blockchain.

Currently, DOTs are integer numbers. You may compare them as Satoshis or Weis.

# Testnet DOTs

DOTs are required to make transactions on the Polkadot network. 
Testnet DOTs do not have any value beside allowing you to experiment with the network.

## Getting DOTs

You may obtain DOTs for the test network on Riot: https://riot.im/app/#/room/#polkadot-watercooler:matrix.org

You may also make your own DOTs if you [become a Validator](https://github.com/paritytech/polkadot/wiki/Validating-on-PoC-2).
