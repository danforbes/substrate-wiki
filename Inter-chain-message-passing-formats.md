Message formats for message passing between chains. This includes three message passing systems: XCMP, HRMP and VMP.

- XCMP Cross-Chain Message Passing: highly scalable message passing between parachains.
- HRMP Horizontal Relay-based Message Passing: message passing between parachains where messages are "manually" relayed by the relay-chain.
- VMP Vertical Message Passing: message passing from the relay-chain itself to a parachain.
