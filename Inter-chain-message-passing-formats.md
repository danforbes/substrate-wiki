Message formats for message passing between chains. This includes three message passing systems: XCMP, HRMP and VMP.

- XCMP (highly scalable message passing between parachains).
- HRMP (message passing between parachains where messages are "manually" relayed by the relay-chain).
- VMP (message passing from the relay-chain itself to a parachain).
